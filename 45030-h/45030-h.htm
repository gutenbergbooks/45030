<h2>
PREFACE.
</h2>


<p>
My object in publishing this little book is to explain a method of
teaching Snap Shooting, by using the rifle in practice, which, by its
economy, ease, quickness, and fascination, will recommend itself to
any who are desirous of becoming skillful in the use of firearms.
</p>

<p>
It is true that by this method almost any one can make himself a good
snap shot in a few weeks or months, according to the amount of
practice indulged in, and that too at very small cost.
</p>

<p>
I make no claim for it, except that having received the original idea
from Dr. Carver, I have demonstrated for myself and seen several
friends demonstrate its practicability beyond a doubt.
</p>

<p>
I submit it for what it may be worth.

<h2>
SNAP SHOOTING DEFINED.
</h2>


<p>
Snap shooting is the throwing of both the rear and front sights of a
gun into line between the eye and the target and pulling the trigger,
all in one motion, and is distinguished by that name from any shooting
where the aim is leisurely taken, by bringing the piece to the
shoulder, getting the sights in line, hunting the target and pulling
the trigger when the aim is most steady.
</p>


<h3>
<i>ANOTHER DEFINITION.</i>
</h3>

<p>
In snap shooting, the eye catches the target, and the attention is
riveted on it, while the piece comes into line instinctively.
</p>

<p>
In other shooting, the attention is turned from the target to the gun
and sights, and after getting them in line, is returned to the target.
</p>

<p>
The practice of snap shooting does not interfere with aiming at
leisure, but aiming at leisure unfits one for snap shooting.
</p>

<p>
When the face is in danger, the hand comes before it instinctively to
protect it; and in the same manner when a target appears the gun
should as instinctively and quickly find its place in line between it
and the eyes.
</p>

<p>
This is necessary to the perfect <i>snap shot</i>.

<h2>
RULES OF SAFETY.
</h2>


<p>
The following rules of safety should <i>never</i> be disregarded:
</p>

<p>
1. On taking a firearm in your hands, see for yourself if it be
loaded or not, and <i>never</i> take any one's word for it.
</p>

<p>
2. Keep the muzzle of a loaded gun above the level of the eye,
and hold a pistol at a corresponding angle.
</p>

<p>
3. Handle <i>all</i> firearms as if loaded.

<span class="sc">Note.</span>&#8212;<i>The Numbers scattered through "The Outfit," and
"Rules of Practice," refer to paragraphs further on, correspondingly
numbered, which are explanatory of terms used, and give the reasons
for the suggestions offered.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>This plan relieves the pith of the book from any confusing
element.</i>
</p>




<h2>
THE OUTFIT.
</h2>


<p>
Three<small>[1]</small> persons purchase a .22<small>[3]</small> calibre rifle,<small>[2]</small> having a
shot-gun<small>[4]</small> stock, and buck-horn<small>[5]</small> or clover-leaf rear sight, a
supply of short cartridges,<small>[6]</small> and a Fletcher bell-ball.<small>[7]</small>
</p>

<p>
The place for practice should be open<small>[8]</small> ground, or in front of a
bulkhead,<small>[9]</small> at least twenty-five feet in height, and three soft pine
boards in thickness.
</p>




<h2>
RULES FOR PRACTICE.
</h2>


<p>
<span class="pad">1.</span> Each should take his turn in the positions of
<span class="sc">Firer</span>, <span class="sc">Tosser</span>, and <span class="sc">Scorer</span>.<small>[10]</small>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">2.</span> The <span class="sc">Tosser</span> should stand ten<small>[11]</small> feet distant from
the <span class="sc">Firer</span>, with his side<small>[12]</small> to him, and toss the bell-ball
about fifteen<small>[13]</small> feet high, and so that it will fall on soft
ground,<small>[15]</small> two or three<small>[14]</small> feet in front of where he (the Tosser) is
standing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">3.</span> The <span class="sc">Firer</span> should disencumber his shoulders of
anything that in any way interferes with their free action, by
removing his coat, vest and suspenders, and stand firmly<small>[16]</small> on his
feet, holding the rifle with the stock below his right<small>[17]</small> elbow, the
muzzle above the level of the eye,<small>[18]</small> and his left hand clasping the
barrel as far out<small>[19]</small> as it can reach with ease when the rifle is
brought to the shoulder in aiming.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">4.</span> The instant<small>[20]</small> the ball is tossed, the rifle should be
brought to the shoulder with as quick a motion as possible, regardless
of the speed the bell seems to have.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">5.</span> When the bell has reached its greatest<small>[21]</small> elevation, just
see it full<small>[22]</small> over the line of both<small>[23]</small> sights and pull the
trigger.<small>[24]</small>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">6.</span> The rifle should not be allowed to get<small>[25]</small> foul, but cleaned
before any burned powder has accumulated in the grooves.<small>[26]</small>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">7.</span> Practice at balls thrown straight<small>[27]</small> up to a uniform height
should continue till tolerable proficiency, say the average hitting of
80 per cent., has been attained, when the direction should be changed
gradually to that of a curve, which lengthened out sufficiently
constitutes the <span class="sc">Cross-shot</span>.<small>[28]</small>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">8.</span> The <span class="sc">Drop-shot</span> is the following of a bell, from its
summit down to within one or two<small>[29]</small> feet of the ground and hitting it
there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">9.</span> The <span class="sc">Incoming-shot</span><small>[30]</small> is at a ball thrown at the
firer from a distance of say 50 feet, and is the easiest of all; but
unless thrown so as to go above his head, and caught by him in passing
over, is not recommended, owing to the danger to the tosser. If a trap
be used it is safe and good practice.
</p>

<p>
10. The <span class="sc">Trap-shot</span> is the most difficult, requires the
quickest<small>[31]</small> action, and is consequently the very best practice, and
is the hitting of balls thrown straight away from the firer by a
spring-trap, or by hand, so that they fall not more than twenty-five
feet distant.
</p>

<p>
11. The above are the cardinal directions, but any variety of
shots can be made at will after these have been mastered.
</p>

<p>
12. Shooting at a bell-ball, suspended by a wire or cord, which
can be done indoors, is excellent practice. The bell is made to swing,
and as each hit gives it a new motion a variety of shots can be tried.
</p>

<p>
13. Balls <i>only</i><small>[32]</small> should be used as flying targets, for
the reason that a bullet may pass very near the center of an
irregularly-shaped object, and not hit it, the miss conveying an
erroneous impression of the aim.
</p>

<p>
14. Quickness<small>[31]</small> of action is <i>most</i> important in snap
shooting, not only in firing but in loading.
</p>

<p>
15. Reload your piece immediately after discharging it, and be
ready to fire again. That you may accustom yourself to be quick in all
your movements, try how many<small>[33]</small> times you can fire, reload, and hit a
bell-ball thrown up perpendicularly in a given time, say one or two
minutes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Note.</span>&#8212;<i>100 consecutive misses at first will not indicate
an inability to learn to hit. Perseverance and attention to the
suggestions here given will make one a good snap shot in less time
than may at first seem possible.</i>
</p>




<h2>
EXPLANATION.
</h2>


<p>
<span class="pad">1.</span> Economy facilitates practice by removing the dread of
expense which takes the keen edge off of any sport and discourages it.
</p>

<p>
The expense of an outfit, consisting of a rifle, one thousand
cartridges, and a bell-ball is less than twenty-five dollars, which
divided between three persons is very light.
</p>

<p>
Three persons can work together to advantage by taking the positions
of firer, tosser and scorer, and benefit by friendly competition.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">2.</span> The rifle should be the elementary arm used in practice, and
be handled with success on all the shots before the shot-gun is taken
up.
</p>

<p>
True impressions only should be given the learner, which the rifle
does, and the shot-gun does not, give.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, the scattering of shot may allow an object to drop
without being hit, when the gun has been held right on it, and again,
a stray shot may hit, when the aim has been high, low, or to one side,
in both of which cases the impressions given the firer are erroneous.
</p>

<p>
With the rifle this cannot occur, and every time one makes a hit he
has received a true impression of the position the sights should hold
relative to the bell.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">3.</span> Rifles of .22 calibre are the best to use in practice, for
several reasons:
</p>

<p class="indent">
    1. The expense of shooting them is very light, owing to the low
    cost of the cartridges.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    2. Because there is no perceptible recoil, which is an important
    consideration, inasmuch as the <i>flinching</i> which a beginner
    does involuntarily, if he stand behind a kicking rifle at first,
    is very hard to overcome; but which he avoids when he has learned
    to hold his gun firm against his shoulder and to brace against it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    3. The rifle does not heat quickly, and in cool weather can be
    fired one hundred times without becoming hot. The reasons for this
    are the thickness of the barrel, and the small quantity of powder
    burned in each cartridge.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    4. It has a light report, scarcely louder than the cracking of a
    whip, and can be used anywhere without being a nuisance on that
    account. In hunting birds or squirrels in a wood, this advantage
    is considerable, because the report does not frighten the game any
    more than the breaking of a twig, and one can move about within a
    limited space, shooting many times at the same game, if not
    successful in hitting it at first, whereas a noisy gun would clear
    the neighborhood after each discharge.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    5. These rifles are a desirable weight, being not lighter than
    about seven pounds, and shoot accurately at ranges of two hundred
    and three hundred yards. It is true that light bullets are more
    easily affected by the wind than heavy, but the ranges are
    generally less than one hundred yards, and in any case it is easy
    to make allowance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">4.</span> It used to be the fashion to make rifle stocks with
projecting points to fit around the shoulder, which was all right for
target practice, but in snap shooting there should be nothing to catch
the sleeve, and consequently the shot-gun stock is recommended.
</p>

<p>
In case your rifle has the points, have the upper one, at least, cut
off.
</p>

<p>
The lower one is no objection, if the stock has sufficient drop for
your length of neck, but if it has not, the catching at the shoulder
will necessitate your ducking your head, which is awkward and
detrimental to rapid work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">5.</span> The <span class="sc">Buckhorn</span> and <span class="sc">Clover Leaf</span> rear sights
are shaped as their names would indicate, and the front sight can be
brought down into them quicker and easier than into others, and there
is less danger of canting the rifle to one side. The buckhorn is
preferable to the clover leaf, and both are infinitely better than the
flat sight, which has only a niche in it. Any gunsmith can change the
sights to suit, or you can put them in yourself if you have them.
</p>

<p>
In shooting point blank at a given distance, with fine sights, if the
rifle shoot low, file off the front sight, which is equivalent to
giving elevation to the bore.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">6.</span> <span class="sc">Short Cartridges</span> are preferable, because they hold
quite as much powder as will burn in the rifle, cost less than the
long, are even more accurate, make less report, and principally
because the <span class="sc">Fletcher Bell Ball</span> is not made to resist a
heavier charge.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">7.</span> The <span class="sc">Fletcher Bell Ball</span> is a metal ball, made up of
two hemispherical gongs, joined by a post of the same metal, all cast
in one piece, and is about two inches in diameter.
</p>

<p>
A space between the gongs allows perfect vibration, and being all one
piece it rings distinctly, no matter where hit, so that it can be
heard several hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
It is practically indestructible and can be hit thousands of times
without being destroyed.
</p>

<p>
John Ruth of Oakland, California, in an exhibition at Badger's park,
in the summer of 1879, hit one nine hundred and ninety times out of
one thousand shots fired, leaving it in good condition for further
use.
</p>

<p>
Its advantages over glass balls are:
</p>

<p class="indent">
    1. It is inexpensive.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    2. It can be carried in the pocket.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    3. It avoids broken glass in the fields.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    4. It is a perfect indicator of hits, telling by its sound if hit
    in the dead center, or is only touched.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    5. It is a new principle in bells, and has greater resonance than
    others of the same metal, because the sound passes through the
    post from the gong which has been hit to the other and is repeated
    there.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    This bell-ball was patented August 6, 1878; and for snap shot
    rifle practice, and as a swinging target in shooting galleries, is
    very useful and economical.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">8.</span> Inasmuch as the bullets are projected high in air in nearly
all the shots recommended, and are quite light, when they are spent
they are harmless, so that long range is not necessary; but it must be
kept in mind, however, that they are projected with much force, and at
two hundred or three hundred yards even, have considerable
penetration, and great care should be taken in giving them direction.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">9.</span> A <span class="sc">Bulkhead</span> to resist short cartridges should be, at
least, three soft pine boards in thickness.
</p>

<p>
10. The keeping of <span class="sc">Scores</span> during practice to show the
progress made by each, is beneficial. At first an occasional hit will
seem like good shooting, while later an occasional miss will seem to
make a bad average, owing to the advanced ideas of the firer, but the
scores will determine the true progress. There will be times when the
learner will shoot easily and well, and others when he may find it
very hard, but practice can develop a skill which will be able to
overcome the influence of shaky nerves.
</p>

<p>
11. The near distance of ten feet is the best range at first
because the object is to hit as easily as possible, but later, as
proficiency is acquired, the tosser may retire till ten yards is
reached, which is far enough for all practical purposes.
</p>

<p>
12. If the tosser stand with his face to the firer he is apt to
divert his attention from the ball, which is in part avoided by
turning his side, and is also the proper position for the delivery of
the drop and other shots.
</p>

<p>
13. Fifteen feet of elevation is sufficient, a higher ball
being really easier to hit, because the firer is more under it.
</p>

<p>
14. The ball thrown perpendicularly is of course the easiest to
hit, but if it fall in front of the tosser two or three feet, the
firer is less liable to be disturbed.
</p>

<p>
15. The metal of the bell being somewhat brittle, if it happen
to fall on a stone or very hard ground in a certain position it will
break the post and disable it.
</p>

<p>
If it fall into mud and fill, or partially fill with it, the sound
will be very much deadened.
</p>

<p>
16. The free use of the shoulders is necessary, and a shooting
suit, consisting of loose shirt, and pants which fit the hips closely,
made of dark blue flannel to avoid the powder stains showing too
plainly, is recommended.
</p>

<p>
Twenty or thirty cartridges can be carried in the hollow of the left
hand, which holds the barrel, and can be got at easily in reloading;
but if they interfere with the holding of the rifle, it is better to
use a pouch or open-mouthed bag suspended in front of the waist.
</p>

<p>
It may seem trivial to mention nice points of position, such as
standing, which any one might know, but in truth there are many little
things which in the aggregate are essential.
</p>

<p>
Intense earnestness, quickness, firmness, the avoiding of diverting
attractions, all help to success though any one may seemingly be
disregarded without prejudice.
</p>

<p>
17. No shot is counted fair unless the stock of the rifle
remain below the elbow till the ball has been thrown.
</p>

<p>
18. After firing, the stock of the rifle is brought down and
held between the elbow and the hip by pressure of the elbow, while the
shell is extracted; the muzzle is then depressed to an angle of
forty-five degrees below the horizontal; the new cartridge inserted
and the breech-block forced into place, when the muzzle is brought to
its position above the level of the eye and the piece cocked.
</p>

<p>
It should be a matter of discipline with all to practice these motions
with a view to making them a habit, in which there is safety and
quickness.
</p>

<p>
19. The farther out on the barrel you can clasp your gun with
your left hand, easily, the better control you will have over it.
</p>

<p>
It is this advantage that tall men have over short, that makes them
frequently better field shots.
</p>

<p>
20. The importance of quickness of motion, cannot be
over-estimated. There is always a tendency to follow the ball up with
the rifle, but the first care should be to get the rifle to the
shoulder as quickly as possible, when time to aim will be secured
before the summit is reached, whereas, tardy action necessitates
hurried firing.
</p>

<p>
21. During the second of time when the ball is at the summit,
it does not seem to have any motion, and is, consequently, the best
time to hit it.
</p>

<p>
22. Seeing the ball <i>full</i> over the sights, means in
reality the allowing for a little drop before the bullet gets there.
</p>

<p>
23. It is the fault of nearly all beginners to uncover too much
of the front sight, and consequently to overshoot. Be careful that the
front sight is well down into the rear when you see the object
finally, and pull.
</p>

<p>
24. The pulling of the trigger must be done without hesitation,
but quickly as soon as the judgment orders it.
</p>

<p>
25. The fouling of the rifle will depend on the ammunition
used. The author has fired as many as five hundred shots from a rifle
without cleaning, while using cartridges of American make, but has not
been able to shoot more than ten of those made by Eley Brothers, of
London, before cleaning, and as the English cartridges cost just twice
as much as the American, the result of the test is strongly in favor
of the latter.
</p>

<p>
26. As soon as burned powder begins to accumulate in the
grooves, it tears the bullet, and accuracy is impossible; the
digression being sometimes several inches in a ten yards flight.
</p>

<p>
When bullets tear you can usually hear them hum when they leave the
rifle.
</p>

<p>
27. The practical value in field shooting, gained by the mere
hitting of balls thrown up perpendicularly, is not great, but as a
preliminary practice it is essential, and should be accomplished
before other directions are given to the bell.
</p>

<p>
28. With practice on the <span class="sc">Cross Shot</span>, and similar ones,
comes the true benefit which is derived from this system, and which
will perfect one in field shooting, not only with a shot-gun on birds,
but with a rifle on running game.
</p>

<p>
The instant the bell is thrown for the cross shot, bring the rifle to
the shoulder as quickly as possible, take aim and follow it, firing as
you go, <i>never</i> stopping the motion to pull the trigger.
</p>

<p>
29. The <span class="sc">Drop Shot</span> is, perhaps, the prettiest as an
exhibition, because the bell is hit just when your spectators think it
has gotten away from you, and is excellent practice. Like the
cross-shot, it teaches an easy sweeping motion of the rifle, which is
the secret of successful snap shooting.
</p>

<p>
Catch the bell just full over your sights and keep it there while you
lead it down.
</p>

<p>
30. The "<span class="sc">Base Ball</span>" or <span class="sc">Incoming Shot</span> at a
bell thrown at the firer by an attendant is dangerous on account of
the possible glancing of the bullets in his direction, and as all
chances of accident should be carefully avoided, it is better not to
try it.
</p>

<p>
31. The <span class="sc">Trap Shot</span>. The glass ball traps ordinarily
used in shot-gun practice, throw glass balls too far for the rifle, at
first, but as the bell-ball is heavier are about the proper strength
for that.
</p>

<p>
The bell should not be thrown so as to fall at a greater distance than
twenty-five feet, and the firer should stand right beside or just
behind the trap.
</p>

<p>
Quickness of motion in getting the rifle to the shoulder becomes a
habit, if persisted in, and is absolutely necessary to success in this
shooting.
</p>

<p>
If the learner, in beginning his practice, is sufficiently impressed
with the importance of the quick first motion of getting his gun to
his shoulder, the instant a mark appears he will find the chief
obstacle to hitting it removed. "Buck fever" means the forgetting that
one has a gun in his hands, in the absorbing interest he takes in the
game in sight.
</p>

<p>
The trigger should not be pulled in a hurry, and never till sure aim
has been taken. Quick action allows deliberate aim, while tardy action
prevents it. I have repeated the lines urging quickness of action,
because too much stress cannot be laid on it.
</p>

<p>
32. <span class="sc">Balls Only</span> should be used as flying targets. When
the beginner has attained some skill in snap shooting with a rifle, he
takes justifiable pride in exhibiting it, by hitting all kind of
things, such as cans, bottles, sticks, coins, pencils and stones, but
it is not well to do so.
</p>

<p>
The impression given every time the rifle is discharged, ought to be a
true one, but when a ball passes near the center of an irregularly
shaped object without hitting it, the impression given is that the aim
was defective, when it was good.
</p>

<p>
33. It is excellent practice, when you have become proficient,
to see how little time it will take you to make a given number of
hits, say twenty, not counting the misses as anything.
</p>

<p>
The less misses you make, the less time you will require.
</p>

<p>
The Tosser should observe the instant the breech block is replaced
after the cartridge has been inserted, and throw immediately without
waiting for instructions.
</p>

<p>
In order to establish a standard of quickness it may be well to state
that the writer has made twenty hits in one minute and sixteen
seconds, and one hundred hits in seven minutes and twenty-nine
seconds.
</p>

<p>
In the first instance he made no misses, but in the second there were
seven misses, making one hundred and seven shots in all; an average of
about four seconds to the shot.
</p>




<h2>
USEFUL HINTS.
</h2>


<p>
Without attempting to treat the subject exhaustively, I will give some
hints on aiming, which being taken by a beginner, will save him much
time.
</p>

<p>
Long practice teaches one to hold in certain positions, under certain
circumstances, but the majority of gunners cannot give reasons for
their doing so.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Point Blank</span> means aiming directly at the object without
making visible allowance for depression or windage.
</p>

<p>
When a rifle is sighted to shoot point blank a given distance, the
front sight is filed off, which acts to depress the line of the
sights, or elevate the line of the bore, which is the same thing,
sufficient to counteract the effect of gravity on the bullet.
</p>

<p>
When firing point blank at a given distance it is natural to suppose,
though all know to the contrary, that the bullet travels in a straight
line between the rifle and the target; or in other words, that the
trajectory is flat, and that the line of the sights and line of the
bore of the rifle are parallel.
</p>

<p>
Flat trajectory is impossible, because the instant the bullet leaves
the rifle it is under the influence of gravity, and in traveling an
inch even is depressed by it.
</p>

<p>
For convenience of description I will call this elevation of the line
of the bore <span class="sc">The Line of Elevation</span>.
</p>

<p>
I shall also term that part of the circle between the horizontal and
perpendicular above, the <span class="sc">Upper Quadrant</span>; and that part
between the horizontal and perpendicular below, the <span class="sc">Lower
Quadrant</span>, and use the figures on the dial of a clock to indicate
the positions of hits on the target.
</p>

<p>
A gun is <span class="sc">Canted</span> when a perpendicular line drawn from the line
of the sights will not intersect the line of elevation.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="sc">Shooting Straight</span>" (an expression legalized by use) means
hitting a target at the point which is in line with the sights.
</p>

<p>
When a rifle is canted, no matter how little, it will not shoot
straight.
</p>

<p>
Unless the contrary is stated it is always supposed that you are
firing point blank at the range for which the rifle is sighted.
</p>

<p>
A bullet projected from a rifle canted to one side, say the left, at
right angles to the upright position, will hit half-past seven
o'clock, because the line of elevation throws it to the left just as
much as gravity pulls it down, to counteract which influence the rifle
must be aimed at half-past one o'clock.
</p>

<p>
If the rifle be held upside down it will shoot very low, because the
line of elevation and gravity both act to depress it.
</p>

<p>
Held in any position between these, the two regular causes of
deflection, gravity and elevation, will influence the shot;
counteracting or aiding each other with mathematical precision, as
they approach or depart from each other; in the upright position, just
counteracting; in the inverted position aiding each other; and in the
side position pulling down at an angle of 45 degrees.
</p>

<p>
In shooting at point blank range horizontally, the line of elevation
is just counteracted by gravity.
</p>

<p>
In shooting straight up or straight down there is no lateral
attraction to affect the course of the bullet, gravity acting only to
aid or retard its speed, consequently the line of elevation will throw
it off the target the full distance.
</p>

<p>
In shooting at any point in either the upper or lower quadrants, aim
low; the lower as you approach either perpendicular.
</p>

<p>
The speed of a bullet diminishes as it travels, and as it requires
much greater time to make the second than the first hundred yards,
gravity has more time to depress it in that distance.
</p>

<p>
In bending backwards to shoot, remember that the rifle is inverted.
</p>

<p>
The flight of a bullet is not in a perfect curve; at first it travels
almost straight, then curves gradually, then abruptly, till finally
when it has lost its momentum, it drops perpendicularly, affected only
by gravity.
</p>

<p>
If you are stationary and your target moves, aim ahead.
</p>

<p>
If you are in motion and your target is stationary aim behind, because
your motion is given to the bullet.
</p>

<p>
If you and your target are both moving in the same direction at the
same speed, near each other, aim at it, but if the distance be great,
aim ahead, because your target keeps up its speed, while the momentum
which you have given the bullet decreases as it travels.
</p>

<p>
The force of wind being irregular and capricious must be judged from
personal observation and experience, but remember, that like gravity,
it has more time to deflect a bullet during its second than during its
first hundred yards flight.
</p>

<p>
Hold the gun firmly against your shoulder to prevent its kicking.
</p>

<p>
To counteract recoil, hold yourself against it by making a slight
movement forward as you fire.
</p>

<p>
The general fault in aiming, in snap shooting, is over-aiming.
</p>

<p>
The front sight should always be brought well down in the rear sight,
which is facilitated by having sufficient drop to the stock of the
piece.
</p>

<p>
Aim at an object going straight away from you, as if it were rising.
</p>




<h2>
TARGET PRACTICE
<br><br>
<span class="small">
COMPARED WITH SNAP SHOOTING.
</span>
</h2>


<p>
The shooting at still targets, either off-hand or from a rest, judging
windage and the elevation required, nice cleaning, regular loading,
etc., are very scientific and good practice for sharp shooting, but
unfit one for snap shooting.
</p>

<p>
To be able to judge distance, windage, the height above or depression
below the level, the speed and direction the object is moving, while
you count one, two, three, is the skill which this system endeavors to
teach, and which is solidly practical.
</p>

<p>
To stand for one or two minutes, with the elbow resting on the hip,
and the hand twisted in an awkward position underneath the trigger
guard waiting for a season of partial paralysis to steady the aim, for
any purposes other than sharp shooting, is unpractical.
</p>

<p>
To rest, either standing or lying is more unpractical still.
</p>

<p>
To be able, in spite of shaky nerves, to throw the rifle, bullet and
all at the object in an instant, is practical.
</p>

<p>
A good snap shot can shoot better off-hand than from a rest, and does
not close either eye, when he aims.
</p>

<p>
Keeping both eyes open comes unsought with practice, and indicates
that the gun has become the servile weapon, which finds its way to its
place between the eyes and the object, without demanding attention,
and delivers its charge direct at the bidding of the master, whose
both eyes are intently watching the course of the target.
</p>

<p>
The brain and finger become so sympathetic that the firing is done
almost without bidding.
</p>

<h2>
EXHIBITION SHOTS
<br><br>
<span class="small">
AT STILL OBJECTS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM.
</span>
</h2>


<p class="hang">
<i>Shooting at a Bell-Ball, suspended by a wire about five feet in
length, at a range of from thirty to fifty feet.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">1.</span> <span class="sc">Rifle Canted Sideways.</span> Aim at half-past one o'clock, two
inches off.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">2.</span> <span class="sc">Rifle Upside Down</span> over the head. Aim at twelve o'clock,
three inches off.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">3.</span> <span class="sc">Mirror Shot.</span> Stand with back to the target, rest the rifle
on the shoulder, hold a small hand mirror back of the sights, and see
the reflection of the target in a line with them. Aim at the target.
This shot is difficult, because a change of position of the mirror has
the same effect as moving the rifle, and steadiness of both is
requisite; also, movements are seemingly reversed in the glass.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">4.</span> <span class="sc">Snuffing a Candle.</span> The wick must be <i>cut</i> by the
bullet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">5.</span> <span class="sc">Exploding Cartridges.</span> Shoot ten holes in a plank, place a
cartridge in each hole, and explode them in ten shots. This shot is
very interesting, but dangerous if the cartridges are pushed into the
holes so that the shell is inserted, because a resistance is made, and
the shells or parts of them are forced back towards the firer. The end
only of the bullet should be covered, and then there is no danger.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">6.</span> <span class="sc">Card Shot.</span> Cut a hole, the size of the barrel, in an
ordinary business card, and slide it on as far as the forward sight.
In looking along the line of sights with one eye, the target will be
obscured; but if both eyes are left open, there will appear to be a
hole in the card through which the target can be seen. The reason of
this is, that while one eye looks at the sights and card, the other
looks past the card at the target, and, of the double impressions
conveyed to the brain, the more distinct ones of the target and sights
unite in one and displace the card. In this shot aim a little to the
left, the more, the nearer the target is to you, because the eyes are
not focussed on the object, but are looking in parallel directions,
consequently the discrepancy of aim is the distance between the eyes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">7.</span> <span class="sc">The Bending Backward or "Athletic Shot"</span> is very difficult
for any but gymnasts, or those who have very limber backs. Stand with
the back to the target, put the rifle to the shoulder as if aiming
horizontally; bend backward till you are aiming at the target with
inverted rifle. Aim high, as in any shot where the rifle is turned
barrel down.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">8.</span> <span class="sc">The Hip Shot</span> is made by holding the stock of the rifle on
the hip and judging the aim. It is very difficult, but not all chance,
for one can observe how his arms are held, and soon learn to
<i>feel</i> if the aim be accurate.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pad">9.</span> Bending forward and <span class="sc">Shooting Between the Legs</span>, holding the
rifle <span class="sc">Back of the Neck</span>, and similar unusual shots, are good
practice, and teach one to overcome adverse positions.
</p>

<p>
10. <span class="sc">Knocking the Ashes off a Cigar</span> in an attendant's mouth,
or apples or potatoes from his head, are fool-hardy shots, which are
not brilliant, and only interest because they are dangerous. No man is
sure of himself, his cartridges, or his rifle. Nervousness, a dirty
rifle, a bullet which does not fill the grooves, the unsteadiness of
the attendant, or other causes of inaccuracy are within the range of
possibility, and any danger, especially where another is liable to be
the sufferer, should be avoided and discouraged by audiences.

<p>
During this shoot, he used five Winchester Repeating Rifles, weighing
about ten pounds each, the aggregated weight of which, raised 6212
times, was about thirty-one tons. Before the first thousand had been
broken, the balls of his eyes became sunburned, and being further
irritated by rubbing them with his powder-stained gloves, the pain
became excruciating, but he hung to his self-imposed task and
accomplished it, and left the field in company with the writer,
physically unstrained. It is true that the greater number of balls
were broken within fifteen feet of the end of the rifle, but it was
nevertheless a wonderful exhibition of skill and endurance.
</p>

<p>
The working of the levers of the rifles, which, when heated, are said
to resist over thirty pounds pressure, with the middle finger of the
right hand, 6212 times, was a monstrous task in itself.
</p>

<p>
In exhibiting before the Prince of Wales at Sandringham, he broke 100
balls consecutively, and successfully made nearly all of the various
shots described here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">John Ruth</span>, of Oakland, California, who was a companion of
Carver during his preliminary practice, has become a successful
exhibitor, and has taught his wife to shoot nearly if not quite as
well as himself. At Badger's Park, in an exhibition, he hit the
bell-ball 990 times out of 1000 shots, as referred to previously.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">John E. Graham</span>, of Erie, Pennsylvania, is reported to have
made 986 hits in 1000 shots, or only 4 less than Ruth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">George A. Meares</span> of Salt Lake City, who is the champion
rifleman of Utah, is enthusiastic in recommending this method, and
claims to have derived immense benefit from it.
</p>

<p>
The late <span class="sc">Major Thornburg</span> was very successful at this kind of
shooting, as well as perhaps hundreds of others, who have so practiced
as to be able to hit 95 per cent. of balls thrown perpendicularly, but
who have yet to get the best benefit from the various shots which are
here recommended.
</p>

<p>
The writer, after having practiced an hour each day for about three
weeks, gave a private exhibition before numerous German army officers,
members of shooting clubs, and others, at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in
which he made the following scores at balls thrown in the air, besides
successfully making the other shots spoken of:
</p>

<p>
Ninety-nine out of 100 balls thrown up perpendicularly; 10 Turning
Shots; 10 One-handed Shots; 10 Cross Shots; 10 Drop Shots; 10 Incoming
Shots; 17 out of 20 from a Bogardus trap; 19 out of 20 English
Pennies.
</p>

<p>
An English gentleman, who was spending his vacation in Frankfort, and
who was a very indifferent shot-gun shot, practiced under instruction
at the same time, and as a result, before he left for home, went out
several times with parties of the best shots in the vicinity, and
bagged more birds than any.

<h2>
FORMING CLUBS.
</h2>


<p>
A range of 100 feet and a bulkhead 25 feet square is all that is
required to make perfect facilities for shooting at reduced still, or
running targets, or at balls thrown in any direction; and for ball
shooting only, a range of 30 feet is sufficient.
</p>

<p>
A club of ten or twenty can build and run such a range anywhere, even
within city limits, at a very light expense; or it is exceedingly
profitable to run one and charge for the shots or ammunition, as a
private enterprise.
</p>

<p>
In this manner unlimited practice can be had at a very light expense.
</p>




<h2>
THE MILITARY AND SNAP SHOOTING.
</h2>


<p>
It may be offered, simply as a suggestion, that the method of practice
recommended in the preceding pages, might be of service in teaching
recruits to handle firearms.
</p>

<p>
Practice in hitting moving objects inspires a confidence which can not
be obtained in any other way, and the repetition of the three motions
of loading, extracting, and aiming and firing, habituates the learner
to a free use of the arms and a confidence in pulling the trigger.
</p>

<p>
In the German army they aim and snap an unloaded piece repeatedly as
an exercise, considering the pulling of the trigger a necessary finish
to the motion of aiming.
</p>

<p>
Aided by a minimum expense, light report, easily-acquired range
facilities, and a most-fascinating system, might not the practice be
carried to firing and hitting, which is the desired result?
</p>

<p>
This need not at all interfere with the manual, but can be practiced
as an outside exercise; and the result of adopting it would be felt
immediately by a company, not only in the ease and quickening of
motion and the improved marksmanship, but in the increased interest it
would create among the members.
